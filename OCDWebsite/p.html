Pure Obsessional OCD (Pure O) – Symptoms and Treatment</h1></font></center>

Some individuals may suffer from “Pure Obsessional OCD” (sometimes called “Pure O”) in which they report experiencing obsessions without observable compulsions. These obsessions often manifest as intrusive, unwanted thoughts, impulses or “mental images” of committing an act they consider to be harmful, violent, immoral, sexually inappropriate, or sacrilegious. For individuals with Pure Obsessional OCD, these thoughts can be frightening and torturous precisely because they are so antithetical to their values and beliefs.
<br>
<center><font color="green"><h1>Symptoms of Pure OCD</h1></font></center>

Symptoms of Pure Obsessional OCD vary widely from person to person. Some examples of common obsessions seen in Pure Obsessional OCD are:
<br><ul>
<li>recurrent intrusive harm thoughts or mental images of physically assaulting or killing one’s spouse, parent, child, self, friends, or others (sometimes called “Harm OCD“)</li>
<li>repeatedly worrying that one has or will run over a pedestrian while driving a vehicle (sometimes called “hit and run OCD)</li>
<li>excessive fears that one might accidentally cause harm to other people (i.e., burning down the house, unknowingly poisoning others, inadvertantly exposing others to toxic chemicals)</li>
<li>persistent fears of molesting a child (sometimes called “pedophile OCD” or “POCD”)</li>
<li>recurrent fears that one might be a homosexual, when in fact he or she is not (sometimes called “Gay OCD” or “Sexual Orientation OCD” or “Homosexual OCD” or “HOCD“)</li>
<li>excessively worrying that one does not actually love his/her partner, or is not with the “right” person (sometimes called “Relationship OCD” or “ROCD“)</li>
<li>repetitive thoughts that one has said or written something inappropriate, such as swearing at ones employer or writing hate-filled letters to a friend</li>
<li>persistent intrusive thoughts or mental images that one considers to be sinful, sacrilegious or blasphemous, such as wanting to worship Satan or have sex with Christ</li>
<li>recurrent fears that one is sinning or not living (or thinking) in a manner that is congruent with their religious, moral, or ethical values (sometimes called “Scrupulosity“)</li>
<li>repeatedly thinking about benign somatic issues such as breathing, swallowing, blinking, eye “floaters”, ringing in the ears, digestion, where ones eyes are looking, physical sensations in a specific body part, etc. (sometimes called “sensorimotor OCD” or “somatic OCD)</li>
<li>recurrent thoughts questioning the nature of the self or reality (sometimes called “existential OCD”)</li>
</ul><br>However, it should be noted that the term “Pure Obsessional OCD” is somewhat of a misnomer. While it may at first appear that these individuals experience obsessions without compulsions, a careful assessment almost always uncovers numerous compulsive behaviors, avoidant behaviors, reassurance-seeking behaviors, and “mental compulsions,”. These behaviors are not as easily observed as other, more obvious OCD symptoms, such as hand-washing and lock-checking, but they are clearly compulsive responses to unwanted obsessions. Some common examples of compulsions seen in Pure Obsessional OCD include:
<ul>
<li>avoiding numerous situations in which one fears the possible onset of unwanted thoughts</li>
<li>repeatedly asking for reassurance that one has not and/or will not commit an act that one perceives as being “wrong” or “bad”</li>
<li>compulsively “checking” one’s body in an effort to get evidence that one is not sexually attracted to someone who he/she considers inappropriate (especially in cases of POCD, HOCD, and ROCD)</li>
<li>silently praying or repeating certain phrases in an effort to counteract or neutralize thoughts that one considers to be sinful, immoral or sacrilegiou</li>s
<li>performing superstitious behaviors in an effort to ensure that bad things don’t happen (i.e., counting, tapping, knocking on wood)</li>
<li>repeatedly confessing to people, even total strangers, that one has had thoughts which he or she considers to be unacceptable</li>
continually ruminating about obsessions in an attempt to prove to oneself that he or she has not done and/or will not do anything “wrong” or “inappropriate” or “sinful”</li></ul>
